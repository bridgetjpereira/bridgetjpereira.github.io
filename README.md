# Portfolio

Portfolio website built in REACT using own illustrations to showcase projects. I used Figma as a design tool to layout a fully responsive, mobile first design. The use of complex data types/ arrays of objects facilitated a modular design approach which allowed for future projects to be easily added without compromising the design uniformity. The website is hosted and can also be viewed on Github.
